# WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityPack

This module increases PowerShell Core 6 compatibility with existing Windows PowerShell scripts and modules by adding more dotnet classes via
the [Windows Compatibility Pack for .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/16/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/),
adding the Windows PowerShell PSModulePath, and includes existinting Windows PowerShell cmdlets that could not be ported to PowerShell Core.

Initiated from https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/16/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/
